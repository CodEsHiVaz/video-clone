## Description

This project demonstrates fetching and displaying videos from an API, implementing pagination for data retrieval, and ensuring a responsive design. When a video is clicked, it will play, and if it doesn't play, a thumbnail will be shown. The tech stack used for this project includes React.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## Features

- Fetch videos from an API.
- Implement pagination for seamless data retrieval.
- Create a responsive design for a great user experience.
- Enable video playback with a fallback thumbnail if the video doesn't play.

## Technologies Used

- React.js (NextJS)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development environment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone hhttps://github.com/CodEsHiVaz/video-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. run the development server:

   ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
   ```


## Usage


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.




1. Upon opening the application, you will be presented with a list of videos fetched from the API.

2. Use the pagination controls to navigate through the list of videos.

3. Click on a video thumbnail to play the video. If the video doesn't play, a thumbnail image will be displayed.
